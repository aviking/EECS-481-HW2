============

My name on github is "aviking"

I am not going to go into the reasons why this game didn't get created because I'm not into excuses. I didn't get all this figured out early enough and that was my fault. So my game is just the program "hello world" this is all that is displayed to the screen. 

To run this app:
	1) open it in Eclipse 
	2) launch an AVD
	3) build and run on the AVD
